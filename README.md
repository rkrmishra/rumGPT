# rumGPT
rumGPT is a self-initiated hobby project built on a large language model framework to deepen my hands-on understanding of parameterization and model behavior. The initial prototype was crafted as the centerpiece demo for my recent meetup talk showcasing LLM Observability while serving as a dynamic, self-learning playground.
